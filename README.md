# TranslatorTranslator

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.1.

The main purpose of the project is to demonstrate how the author (me) can work with RxJS and practice such important framework.

The technology stack contains: Angular and RxJS for front-end, Firebase Realtime Database as the main database.

## How to work with the application?

Very easely. You just should authorize by your google profile and get started.

1. Search some interesting for yourself words. If such expression is here, all meanings will appear in the dedicated section, if not - you will see according message. If there is some error, you will see it as well.
2. If the word is important to you, you can mark it as a favourite and next found it in the user section (link at in top right). The app handles not only adding of words, but also removal.

That's it.

In the near future I'd like to implement AI and real translation mechanism, not only dictionary functionality.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
